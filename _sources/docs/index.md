Thank you for choosing to go over Quick JavaScript; throughout this tutorial you will learn the whole concept of programming and ultimately become a better JavaScript Developer. It is my hope that over time I will be able to get partners and recognised institutions that will be able to issue or certify, a certificate of completion to be issued upon completion of this turorial.
